# Spinous process localization in ultrasound images with FCN + robotic navigation

This work is an implementation of the paper: "Follow the Curve: Robotic-Ultrasound Navigation with Learning Based Localization of Spinous Processes for Scoliosis Assessment"
Authors: Maria Victorova, Michael Ka-Shing Lee, David Navarro-Alarcon and Yongping Zheng

## "FCN" folder
This folder contains the script to train the network to detect Spinous Process. The network input is ultrasound images of spinous process and correspondent labels in a form of Gaussian drawn around the spinous process location.
